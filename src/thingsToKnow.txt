From pgil, whose messy code causes problems, some tips:

1. Things will not work if loadTabs() has not been called yet
    a. The upshot: never attempt to interface with HTML in constructors, do it in render() or whatever
    
2. Things will re-render themselves all the time
    a. Make sure u have a piece of state somewhere that can store the HTML's state whenever it changes
